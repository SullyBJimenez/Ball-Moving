# Ball Moving

This is a ball moving exercise where I have one green ball, one yellow ball, and one red ball. The green ball moves very quickly within the paramters that I created for it. When the green ball hits the parameter, the red ball will show up where it touched the parameter, and the green ball will change direction. The yellow ball moves around but at a slower pace.
